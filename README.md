# data-cleaning

This is a simple dataset listing all of the U.S. presidents.
The initial dataset contained columns with incorrect data types, extra white space, and non-standerdized formatting. 
I cleaned the dataset by removing the duplicates, utlizing the TRIM/PROPER functions and standardizing each column.
